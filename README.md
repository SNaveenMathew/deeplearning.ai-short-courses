## Downloading the required files

1. Click View -> File Browser
2. Select multiple files at a time and click 'Download' because it's impossible to install `zip` or any other tool without having admin rights

## Conda environment

To avoid complications create a separate environment to install dependencies. Use multiple environments if required to isolate dependency issues

## Installing dependencies

1. Activate the environment first using 'conda activate <env_name>'. Eg: conda activate dlai-short-courses. Environment name will be listed in the first line of the dependencies.sh file as a comment
2. Copy-paste each line from the respective dependencies.sh file and execute in command-line to install using conda or pip
